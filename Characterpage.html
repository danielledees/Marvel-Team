                                  <p>Generic character description Dormammu first appeared in Strange Tales #126–127 (November – December 1964), but had been mentioned previously in dialog, along with his realm the "Dark Dimension".

                                        Writer Mike Conroy said:
                                        
                                        To Lee and Steve Ditko, the Lord of the Realm of Darkness and the associated invocations were just another piece of business, another way of adding depth to the otherwordly nature of Strange's adventures. However, the readers were intrigued. They wanted to know more. "It seems there was something about that nutty name, Dormammu, that was keeping Doc's devoted disciples awake at nights trying to figure out who Dormammu was," Lee explained. "I knew I was in big trouble. I had made up the name—now I had to dream up a character to go with the name. But who? How?
                                        
                                        Ditko visualized the answer. "He gave the demoniac DD...a visage totally different from any villain I had ever seen in comics before," proclaimed Lee.[2]
                                        
                                        After being established as the ruler of an alternate dimension (later described as the god-tyrant of its denizens),[3] Dormammu became a perennial foe of Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat "one-off" mystical threats in Strange Tales #110–125 (July 1963 – October 1964). Strange's first encounter with Dormammu in the "Dark Dimension" also introduced Clea, eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea's name, this was not initially revealed in Strange Tales #126; November 1964), and the monstrous and imprisoned Mindless Ones.
                                        
                                        Major appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in Strange Tales #131–146 (April 1965 – July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, Umar, and both are in fact mystical beings called Faltine in Strange Tales #150 (November 1966); teaming with fellow villain Loki to instigate the "Avengers-Defenders War" in Avengers #115–118 (September – December 1973) and Defenders #8–11 (September – December 1973); Thor Annual #9 (1981); Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #1–2 (November 1988 & January 1989) and the limited series Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones #1–4 (February – May 1999) and Hellcat #1–3 (September – November 2000).
                                        
                                        After a major appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #498–500 (October – December 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the Hood in New Avengers #46 (December 2008).
